# SciQuizHero Organization

Welcome to SciQuizHero, where we're making science fun and accessible through interactive quizzes. We've built a broad platform that lets you test your knowledge across a wide range of scientific topics.

## Tech Stack

We're proud of the tech we're using to bring SciQuizHero to life:

- **Backend Infrastructure**: We've chosen AWS (Amazon Web Services) to host our backend infrastructure, offering a reliable foundation for our apps.
- **Server**: Our server is a lean Node.js application working with MongoDB, all running smoothly on an AWS EC2 instance.
- **API**: We're using AWS Lambda to handle our API requests. It's a great solution that lets us focus on developing the features you love without worrying about server management.
- **Mobile Apps**: We're using Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android. These modern languages help us ensure our apps are fast, reliable, and a pleasure to use.

At SciQuizHero, we're tech enthusiasts. We started with Node.js and Express.js for our backend, but we're always interested in other technologies. We're open to changing and evolving our tech stack to keep making SciQuizHero software better.

## Repositories

Our organization hosts several repositories, each focusing on a different aspect of our platform.

### [Android App](https://github.com/SciQuizHero/SciQuizHero-Android-client)
The Android client for our Science Quiz App. This app is being actively developed and aims to provide a rich, engaging interface for users to test their science knowledge.

### [iOS App](https://github.com/SciQuizHero/SciQuizHero-iOS-client)
The iOS client for our Science Quiz App. Like the Android client, this app is under active development and aims to provide a seamless quiz experience for Apple users.

### [Mock Server](https://github.com/SciQuizHero/sci-quiz-hero-mock-server)
This repository contains a mock server for testing the apps. It's designed to mimic the actual production server behavior.

### Server Infrastructure and CLI Tools
We also maintain several private repositories related to server infrastructure and command-line tools to support our application development.

## Future Plans

We're constantly working to enhance our apps and provide a better user experience. In the future, we plan to add:

- **Achievement System**: Recognize the efforts of our users by awarding achievements based on their quiz performance.
- **Progress Tracking**: Allow users to monitor their progress and see how much they've learned over time.

## Contributions

The development of our iOS and Android apps is open source. We encourage contributions from the community. For contribution guidelines, please refer to the individual repository's Contributions section found in the readme.
